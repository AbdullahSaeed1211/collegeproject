# Alzheimer's Disease Detection Model

A deep learning model for detecting Alzheimer's disease and predicting its progression using brain MRI scans.

## Model Details

- **Architecture**: 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with attention mechanisms
- **Input Format**: 3D MRI brain scan images (NIfTI format preferred, also supports DICOM)
- **Output Classification**:
  - Non-Demented (Normal)
  - Very Mild Dementia
  - Mild Dementia
  - Moderate Dementia
- **Framework**: TensorFlow with FastAPI

## API Endpoints

### `/api/predict`

Analyzes brain MRI scans for Alzheimer's disease markers and returns classification results.

**Methods**: POST  
**Content Type**: multipart/form-data or application/json

#### Option 1: Direct Image Upload

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://yourusername-alzheimers-model.hf.space/api/predict \
  -F "file=@/path/to/brain_scan.nii.gz"
```

#### Option 2: Image URL

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://yourusername-alzheimers-model.hf.space/api/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"image_url": "https://example.com/brain_scan.nii.gz"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "prediction": "Very Mild Dementia",
  "confidence": 0.88,
  "class_probabilities": {
    "non_demented": 0.09,
    "very_mild": 0.88,
    "mild": 0.02,
    "moderate": 0.01
  },
  "biomarkers": {
    "hippocampal_volume_percentile": 23,
    "ventricle_enlargement": "moderate",
    "cortical_thinning": "mild"
  },
  "processing_time_ms": 1250
}
```

### `/api/progress-prediction`

Estimates potential disease progression based on current scan and demographic information.

**Method**: POST  
**Content Type**: application/json

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://yourusername-alzheimers-model.hf.space/api/progress-prediction \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "current_class": "Very Mild Dementia",
    "age": 72,
    "gender": "female",
    "education_years": 16,
    "apoe4_status": 1
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "progression_risk": {
    "6_month": 0.12,
    "1_year": 0.23,
    "3_year": 0.67
  },
  "recommended_followup": "6 months"
}
```

### `/api/status`

Check model status and get basic information.

**Method**: GET

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ready",
  "model_version": "2.1.0",
  "supported_formats": ["nii", "nii.gz", "dcm"],
  "biomarkers_supported": true
}
```

## Web Interface

The model includes a comprehensive web interface for clinical researchers:
- Support for batch uploading of patient scans
- Interactive 3D visualization of brain regions
- Region-of-interest (ROI) highlighting for affected areas
- Longitudinal tracking for patient progression
- PDF report generation

Access the interface at: `https://yourusername-alzheimers-model.hf.space`

## Implementation Details

### Preprocessing Pipeline
- 3D volume standardization to isotropic resolution
- Skull stripping and brain extraction
- Intensity normalization and bias field correction
- Registration to standard template (MNI152)
- Segmentation of key brain structures (hippocampus, ventricles, cortex)

### Model Features
- Multi-scale feature extraction for capturing both fine and coarse details
- Attention mechanisms to focus on most affected regions
- Transfer learning from larger datasets (ADNI)
- Ensemble of models for robust predictions
- Explainable AI features with attention maps

### Performance
- Accuracy: ~94% on validation dataset
- Sensitivity: 92%
- Specificity: 95%
- Average inference time: ~2s per volume

## Deployment

To run this model locally:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/yourusername/alzheimers-model
cd alzheimers-model
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the server:
```
python app.py
```

## Limitations

- The model is for research and educational purposes only
- Not intended for clinical diagnosis
- Performance may vary based on scanner type, field strength, and acquisition parameters
- Best results with 3T MRI scanners and standardized acquisition protocols
- Limited validation in diverse ethnic populations
- Requires high-quality scans with minimal motion artifacts

## Dataset

The model was trained on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, which includes:
- 1,000+ subjects across the dementia spectrum
- Longitudinal scans (baseline + follow-up)
- Comprehensive clinical data
- Various MRI sequences (T1, T2, FLAIR)

## Integration with BrainHealth AI

This model serves as the backend for the BrainHealth AI platform's Alzheimer's assessment module, providing non-invasive screening that can be conducted remotely and interpreted quickly.
